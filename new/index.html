          Troops loyal to the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, have retaken the key oil port of Ras Lanuf, forcing rebel fighters into a chaotic retreat under a barrage of tank and artillery fire.

Nato planes bombarded the regime troops as their outgunned opponents continued to fall back from positions taken earlier in the week, when they had advanced within 60 miles of Sirte, Gaddafi's home city.

Meanwhile, as the debate within the anti-Gaddafi international coalition over the legality of arming the rebellion continued, the foreign secretary, William Hague, said that it would be possible to supply weapons under certain circumstances.

Earlier, David Cameron told the Commons that no decision had been made but he "would not necessarily rule out the protection of civilians in certain circumstances".

The rebel's rapid withdrawal came just days after insurgent fighters raced westwards following the destruction of government tanks and artillery in five days of aerial bombardment in the town of Ajdabiya.

Ragtag opposition fighters have repeatedly been forced to retreat after fierce bombardments by the more disciplined government troops.

"Gaddafi hit us with huge rockets. He has entered Ras Lanuf," rebel fighter Faraj Muftah told Reuters after pulling out of the oil port.

"We were at the western gate in Ras Lanuf and we were bombarded," said a second fighter, Hisham.

Scores of rebel four-wheel pick-ups raced east, away from Ras Lanuf, a Reuters journalist saw.

Speaking to the Commons, Hague revealed that five Libyan diplomats had been expelled from the regime's London embassy because they represented a potential security risk.

Hague said that while the current arms embargo prevented weapons being provided to the whole of Libya, UN resolution 1973 allowed "for all necessary measures to protect civilians" to be taken.

The British government's view, which was not necessarily shared internationally, was that this meant rebels protecting civilians could be armed although ministers had "not yet taken a decision", he said.

Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said on Tuesday that she believed arming rebels was legal under the UN security council resolution which sanctioned the no-fly zone and air operations. But experts in international law have questioned this interpretation, saying that it would breach the arms embargo on Libya agreed last month.

There also remain questions about who is represented in the interim national council (INC) guiding the uprising.

In Washington, Admiral James Stavridis, Nato's supreme allied commander in Europe, told the Senate that intelligence reports had suggested "flickers" of al-Qaida or Hezbollah presence within the rebel movement. A UK diplomat, Christopher Prentice, the ambassador in Rome, met rebel leaders in their stronghold of Benghazi on Monday and Tuesday, the Foreign Office has said.

Cameron told the Commons during prime minister's questions: "In terms of the situation on the ground it is an extremely fluid situation, but there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the ceasefire is still being breached and it is absolutely right for us to keep up our pressure under UN security council resolution 1973."

Asked by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, whether the terms of the resolution that authorised "all necessary measures" to protect Libyan civilians, overrode the arms embargo, Cameron said: "I have said before in the House that we must do everything to comply with both the security council resolutions.

"The arms embargo applies to the whole of the territory of Libya, but at the same time UN security council resolution 1973 allows all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas.

"Our view is that this would not necessarily rule out the provision of assistance to those protecting civilians in certain circumstances. We do not rule it out but we have not taken the decision to do so."
